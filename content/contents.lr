title: About
---
body: I am a Senior Research Scientist in the [Climate Modeling group](https://allenai.org/climate-modeling) at the [Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://allenai.org) and a member of the [FV3 Team](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/fv3/) at the [NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov).  I received my Ph.D. from the [Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Program at Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/aos/) where I studied topical atmospheric dynamics using an idealized moist general circulation model. Prior to that, as an undergraduate student at Cornell University, I worked on simulating the climate impacts of aerosols released from forest fires and investigated the varied future projections of lightning flash density by different lightning parameterizations.
