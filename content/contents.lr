body: I am a software engineer for climate model development at [Vulcan Inc.](https://www.vulcan.com), supporting a project aimed at improving the parameterization of sub-grid-scale processes in a coarse-resolution climate model using machine learning.  I received my Ph.D. from the [Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Program at Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/aos/) where I studied topical atmospheric dynamics using an idealized moist general circulation model. Prior to that, as an undergraduate student at Cornell University, I worked on simulating the climate impacts of aerosols released from forest fires and investigated the varied future projections of lightning flash density by different lightning parameterizations.
