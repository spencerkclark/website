body:

I am a fourth-year graduate student in the [Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Program](https://www.princeton.edu/aos/) at Princeton University whose interests lie at the intersection of tropical atmospheric dynamics, idealized general circulation models, and Python.  In the past I have worked on simulating the climate impacts of aerosols released 
from forest fires and investigated the varied future projections of lightning flash density by different lightning parameterizations.
